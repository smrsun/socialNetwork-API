NoSQL database

## Task Description 
My task was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM as well as Express JS and Mongoose databases.
